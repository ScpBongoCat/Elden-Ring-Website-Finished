    <p>
      Elden Ring follows the story of a tarnished warrior awakening in The Lands
      Between, a land spilling with blood and war from the shattering of its
      great Elden Ring by the hands of Queen Marika, in which it is your duty to
      guide this warrior through The Lands Between defeating great legends,
      powerful warriors, and accursed rulers to reassemble the pieces of the
      shattered Elden Ring

    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>
      The first area which a tarnished arrive in in the lands between are the
      Sprawling fields of Limgrave, a land of never seen before creatures,
      giants, dragons, and most importantly ruled by the wretched Godrick the
      Grafted, a pitiful excuse for a Lord gains his powers by grafting
      different body parts onto himself but before reaching his castle another
      foe awaits...
    </p>
    <h2>Margit the Fell Omen</h2>
    <p>
      Protecting the castle of Godrick the Grafted is Margit the Fell Omen, a
      child of royal blood cast out because of his omen curse, and here to stop
      any tarnished who wants to challenge the ruler of Limgrave
    </p>
    <h2>Godrick the Grafted</h2>
    <p>
      After defeating Margit you may now navigate Stormveil Castle, a place
      riddled with traps, enemies, and the lord of all that is golden, Godrick,
      Once you go through the castle you may meet the shardbearer of Limgrave,
      Godrick the Grafted during the fierce battle versus the amalgamated mess
      of grafted limbs which he will use his battleaxe to swing at you and
      demenish your healthbar, after Godrick has lost half his health he will
      cut off his own arm and graft the head of a mighty dragon onto it for the
      last phase of the fight you wont forget as he spews dragonfire around the
      arena.
    </p>
    <h2>The Roundtable Hold</h2>
    <p>
      After this victory versus Godrick you will be able to access the meeting
      place of all noteable Tarnished warriors, The Roundtable Hold, this place
      serves as a resting place and shop for any tarnished that has accomplished
      large feats in the Lands Between, including you now,you will be greeted by
      a few of its residents such as Gideon Ofnir, Corhyn, Diallos, D Hunter of
      the Dead, Master Hewg, and many other characters, use this area as a a
      shop to refresh after battles or a long adventure.

      the game Liurnia of the Lakes which houses many interesting areas such as
      the frenzyflamed village, Caria Manor and the most important Raya Lucaria,
      school of magic. To enter this area you will need to find a key that can
      be located west of the academy protected by a glintstone dragon, slay this
      beast and you will be on your way to Raya Lucaria
    </p>
    <h2>Rennala Queen of the Full Moon</h2>

      home of the second shardbearer Rennala Queen of the Full Moon. naviagting
      your way through may be difficult with the number of illusionary walls and
      magic weilding enemies there are difficult but you can slowly make your
      way through defeating the Red Wolf of Radagon along the way and eventually
      you will come face to face with Queen Rennala. In the first phase of this
      fight you will need to diminish the number of Rennala's children focusing
      down the ones carrying golden glowsto break her shield. Do this a couple
      time and Queen Rennala will move onto here second stage. In the nxt stage
      Rennala will fire out a multitude of powerful magical attacks aswell as
      summoning enemy spirits like the giants or even a dragon. Rennala is
      incredibly weak in her health and can be taken down in a very short time
      if powerful enough and the battle will be yours
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the next regions you can travel to in elden ring is the deserted
      rotten lands of Caelid, a region full of death and the next shardbearer on

    <p>
      The Radahn Festival, a triumphant tradition gathering champions from
      around the Lands between to take a shot at taking down the demigod Radahn,
      when you start the festival there will be multiple summon signs around for
      the many different characters to join the festival or you could take the
      difficult route and not summon any, but that is your choice to make. Not
      depending on either you choose to summon or not this will be a difficult
      battle, Radahn boasts a massive health bar with strong fast attacks to
      boot so taking him down will not be easy. When you bring his health to
      half by dodging the massive sword swings and gravity attacks Radahn will
      enter phase two jumping into the atmosphere, Radahn comes crashing down in
      ball of scorching fire has his attacks become more violent and desperate
      but as you widdle the health down you can finally defeat him to claim the
      3rd shard of the elden ring.
    </p>
    <h2>Altus Plateau</h2>
    <p>
      The next area is the home of the Erdtree itself sprawling golden lands
      tainted by the actions of warfare, your sure to discover many things here
      such as the Windmill Village and the most important area Leyndell Royal
      Capital.

      (Refer to previous bosses for info) and then your allowed to enter the
      capitol. Leyndell is full of strong enemies, hidden paths, and many items

      first boss of the area Godfrey, the First Elden Lord, or atleast a ghost
      of him defeat him and continue the short walk to the main boss of Leyndell
    </p>
    <h2>Morgott, The Omen King</h2>

      As the cutscene starts you can see Margit climb down the stairs and
      reveals his true indentity as the true king of Leyndell, Morgott the Omen
      King this boss fight is a difficult one as Morgott has his Brutal fast
      attacks from before aswell as using holy damaging spells and a weapon to
      inflict bleed but aslong as you learn the attack patterns and make sure to
      dodge you will be able to defeat him opening up the path to the Erdtree,
      but unfortunatly the Erdtree's entrance is blocked by a wall of thorns and
      after asking around you will be tasked with burning the Erdtree with the
      Forge of the Giants and the Mark of Eternal Death to open the Erdtree once
      and for all and too rebuild the Elden Ring
    </p>
    <h2>Volcano Manor</h2>
    <p>
      Before travelling to the mountaintop theres 1 last shardbearer to find
      located in Volcano Manor hidden among the depths of the volcano. To get
      there you will to climb the volcano west of the Altus Plateau then you
      will need to enter the Manor and talk to Lady Tanith, master of the Manor.

      mini-dungeon of Volcano manor or you can fufill the requests of Lady
      Tanith to finally be able to face Rykard Lord of Blasphemy
    </p>
    <h2>Rykard Lord of Blasphemy</h2>
    <p>
      Entering into the chamber you can see a Figure of a giant snake in the
      distance, grab the spear weapon from the side and prepare for one of the
      most cinematic fights in the game. As you approach the snake will wake up
      and attack you with a flurry of moves from tail to head you will be
      dgodging and dishing out damage with the hunter spear constantly, and
      after you lower the serpents health Rykard Lord Of Blasphemy will show
      himself, Rykard attached to the back of the serpent reveals himself and
      prepares for battle, in this state he will do amny attacks with his sword,
      fire spells, and the previous serpent attacks it wont be an easy fight but
      the beast will eventually go down for you to claim the 4th Great Rune
    </p>
    <h2>Mountaintop of the Giants</h2>
    <p>
      From Leyndell you can enter the next area of the game that being the
      Mountaintop of the Giants trough an elevator which can be found in
      Leyndell, The Mountaintop of the Giants is a vaste area full of powerful
      enemies and some of the best weapons in the game such as the Rivers Of
      Blood. Travel up and around the mountaintop to reach the next point of
      progression in the game.
    </p>
    <h2>Fire Giant</h2>
    <p>
      Following up the mountain you will reach another golden boss gate to face
      the Fire Giant, this boss is among the largest and tankiest in the game so
      using percentage status effects like blackflame or bleed is advised, this
      bosses weak spot can be spotted by the scars already on his body located
      on his leg underneath a little bit of protection, break the protection and
      dodge his fire attacks and you wil be able to go to phase 2 to fight.
      During phase 2 of this fight the Fire Giant will use many fire realted
      attacks that you must dodge, these do deal a ton of damage so you will
      need to react fast. Since in this phase Fire Giant has gotten rid of his
      injured leg there are only 3 weak spots 2 on either arm and his eye when
      it opens so make sure you take that advantage whenever possible and before
      you know iot Fire Giant will be defeated.
    </p>
    <h2>Concencrated Snowfield</h2>
    <p>
      Before heading up to the forge you will want to travel to the Concencrated
      Snowfield. By gathering 2 medallion pieces located in a castle at the top
      of Mountaintop Of the Giants and the 2nd piece located in Liurnia you can
      use the secret medallion to travel to the Snowfield, this area is very
      desolate having only a few areas to go, one of the mst important being
      Ordina the Liturgical Town here you will find an area where you have to
      light torches while being shot by arrows and being tracked down by
      invisible black knife assassins to open p a path to a fabled Haligtree
    </p>
    <h2>The Haligtree</h2>
    <p>
      The Haligtree is one of the games most difficult areas housing some of the
      most difficult enemies and plenty of scarlet rot to boot. The trravel down
      the tree is very dificult but rewarding as there are many items and runes
      to aquire. A few tips for before entering is aquiring the ability to get
      rid of rot (either through spells like flame cleanse me, or rejuvinating
      boluses) aswell as having ample levels (level 120-150 is good for this
      area). After climbing down the tree you better be prepared for the most
      difficult boss in this game
    </p>
    <h2>Malenia Blade of Miquella</h2>
    <p>
      Highly regarded as Elden Rings most difficult boss Malenia Blade of
      Miquella, with fast attacks and having the ablity to heal whenever she
      hits you, plus her dreaded Waterfowl dance this boss is nothing to be
      toying around with. A great way of dealing with her is with a multitude of
      status effect. She is both weak too bleed and frost effects and can have
      her waterfowl dance cancelled mid attack. This boss may be difficult but
      with enough perseverence and preperation you can do it, and dont be
      ashamed if you cant beat her there are plenty of people ready to summon
      who have studied her moveset and wanting to help you during the fight.
    </p>
    <h2>Mohgwyn Palace</h2>
    <p>
      In the Consencrated Snowfield theres a secret entrance to the Mohgwyn
      Palace, hiding place of the shardbearer Mohg Lord of Blood. This area is
      one of the most difficult in the game having many enemies which inflict
      bleed and attack fast. Following up the stairs you can dodge many undead
      blood enemies and the Sanguine Nobles in the caves to reach an elevator up
      to the Mausoleum where you will find Mohg Lord of blood along with a dead
      Miquella
    </p>
    <h2>Mohg Lord of Blood</h2>
    <p>
      This shardbearer uses the power of the Formless Mother to cast blood
      incantations aswell as using his trident to stab and slash everything in
      an area, a great way to avoid these attacks is to stay far away, using
      ranged spells can be a great asset in this fight. Once Mohg has half hp he
      will use a certain atack building up levels of blood loss instantly and
      killing you if not dealt with. Two ways of contering this include just
      spamming your healing potions or aquiring the bloody crystal tear from the
      Second Church of Marika. in his second phase his attacks will become more
      frantic and powerful just continue dodging and you should be able to
      aquire another Great Rune.
    </p>
    <h2>Crumbling Farum Azula</h2>
    <p>
      After exploration you can now travel to the Forge of the Giants, make your
      way around the left side, sit at the site of grace, watch a quick cutscene
      and off to Crumbling Farum Azula you go. this area is infested with the
      dragons of the old age aswell as users of ancient dragon magic. To
      traverse this area you must hop between different islands of Farum Azula
      dodging and fighting your way through until eventually reaching the first
      boss of the area, The Godskin duo. After defeating the duo and travelling
      up the area and defeating a draconic tree sentinel you can enter the arena
      to the protector of the Mark of Eternal Death
    </p>
    <h2>Dragon Lord Placidusax</h2>
    <p>
      But before you do you can follow a simple path down and lay down on an
      open grave. As time stops and rewinds you come face to face with the true
      first owner of the Elden Ring, Dragon Lord Placidusax. This king of all
      ancient dragons attacks using lightning and different swipes and bites
      from the dragon will sure to keep you moving. The dragon after receiving a
      substancial amount of damage will start swooping down from the skies,
      these should be avoided as they deal quite a bit of damage. after getting
      him down more he will use Placidusax's Fury, a beam of pure fire. Dodging
      this sould be priority number 1 as getting hit by it is pretty much
      instant death, and after a long battle the Dragon Lord will fall.
    </p>
    <h2>Beast Clergyman</h2>
    <p>
      Entering the arena from before the foe ahead of you is the Beast Clergyman
      protector of the Mark of Eternal Death with a quick flurry of physical
      based attacks that can dish out lots of damage in a very short amount of
      time... make sure you learn the attack patterns and you can lower his hp
      in where a cutscene will play...
    </p>
    <h2>Maliketh the Black Blade</h2>
    <p>
      Stabbing the rune keeping the Mark of Eternal Death at bay the beast
      transforms into Maliketh the Black Blade. This boss os fast, and paired
      with the black flame inflicting attacks this is not an easy battle, and
      with his defeat you can claim the Mark of Eternal Death and burn the
      Erdtree.
    </p>
    <h2>Leyndell Capital of Ash</h2>
    <p>
      Being teleported back to Leyndell we can witness it covered in ash as the
      Erdtree burns above travelling back through the capital you travel to the
      room where you fought the ghost of Godfrey before and witness an old
      friend
    </p>
    <h2>Sir Gideon Ofnir the All Knowing</h2>
    <p>
      Sir Gideon Ofnir the All Knowing learning knowledge about Queen Marika
      herself forbids any tarnished from entering the Erdtree challenging you to
      a final battle to stop you from getting to the Erdtree, Gideon uses every
      spell you can learn from the remembrance bosses drop and bases which ones
      he can use off the bosses you have defeated already. defeating every boss
      up to this point will make this a difficult fight but is fairly easy if
      you've done some pvp up to this point, just stay calm, dodge and deal as
      much damage as possible as his healthbar is quite low and before you know
      it the path back up to the Ertdree will be open.
    </p>
    <h2>Godfrey, First Elden Lord</h2>
    <p>
      Travelling through the golden gate awaits Godfrey, the First Elden Lord
      holding the corpse of Morgott, his dead son, in this final battle all the
      stops come out as Godfrey protects the Erdtree and his heritage. Godfrey
      will attack using his axe and will hit hard with slow attacks and stomps
      dodging these will be a necessity, but before long you will widdle down
      the hp bar...
    </p>
    <h2>Hoarah Loux, Warrior</h2>
    <p>
      Being close to his final straw Godfrey breaks the neck of his dear lion
      spirit releasing his inner rage from the time of the badlands, going back
      to his past he transforms into his true form, Hoarah Loux, Warrior. This
      phase is completly different with a flurry of quick grabs and punches he
      is sure to keep you on your toes but before long the Warrior will fall
      leaving you with the burned path to the Erdtree.
    </p>
    <h2>Radagon of the Golden Order</h2>
    <p>
      Entering the Golden Fog you come across Marika hanging on the sigil of the
      Elden Ring for her crimes of smashing it, as the sigil cracks and Marika
      falls down we witness as she changes form into Radagon, husband of Marika
      and Ruler of the Golden Order. As he picks up the hammer used to smash the
      Elden Ring he starts his attack with a flurry of holy and physical based
      attacks, This boss has many difficult attacjks to dodge but it nt very
      difficult to beat nonetheless and once he falls the true battle begins.
    </p>
    <h2>Elden Beast</h2>
    <p>
      Out of the body of Marika comes a hand and then the body of the Great
      Elden Beast, sensing that you wont be a pawn to its cause the outer Gods
      have sent a beast to end you before aquiring the Elden Ring, With ist
      large healthbar and various Holy based attacks this boss serves as the
      final challenge of the game stopping you from repairing the Elden Ring.
      With your best gear in hand and the journey behind you slay the Elden
      Beast.
    </p>
    <h2>Final</h2>
    <p>

      the Elden Lord
